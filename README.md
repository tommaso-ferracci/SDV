## SDV

Fork of [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV), implementing for both TVAE and CTGAN a custom early stopping condition on the weighted average across features of the Kolgomorov-Smirnov statistic between real and synthetic data. The user can specify the patience and the weights. The class automatically saves the best model.
